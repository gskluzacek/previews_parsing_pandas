validate the count of lines on the final preview lines table matches the total given by: `wc -l *.txt`
validate the count of distinct pvh_id, pvl_seq is the same as total count
validate the count of IDENT lines = count of all header lines minus the count of header lines with a ident type of 44, 2, 3, 4
make sure the text for the ident lines `maches up` the counts for header ident types 10, 20, 30
